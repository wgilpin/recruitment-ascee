Dead men naked they shall be one with the man in the wind and the Westmoon. When their bones are picked clean, and the clean bone gone the shall have stars at their elbows and feet. Though they go mad, they shall be sane. Though they sink through the sea, they shall rise again. Though lovers be lost, love shall not. And death shall have no dominion.

And death shall have no dominion. Under the windings of the sea. They lying long shall not die windily. Twisting on racks when sinews give way. Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break. Faith in their hands shall snap in two. And the Unicorn evils run them through. Split all ends up they shan't crack. And death shall have no dominion.`,

Goonswarm Federation's largest member Corporation where Eve's most knowledgeable veterans help teach pilots to fly.   New players come here to learn from the best, old players come here to revitalize their Eve experience.  KarmaFleet has an abundance of unique supportive services available only to our pilots like Corp level SRP{on top of Alliance SRP}, ISK payouts to our FCs, and a PLEX for PVP program that rewards our pilots.  If you are looking for the perfect mixture of an extremely active and yet well organized experience this is the Corporation for you.

Our recruitment application has been offline since the swapover to ESI.  We are having to use a less than optimal process while the new application is finalized. Stop by our public channel to chat about where things stand and how you can get in the mix KF_Public. A list of current recruiters can be found in the channel's MOTD. Applications are thoroughly reviewed and do take time to process.  Please be patient.

Applications that have not been first submitted through our recruitment website will be declined.

Karmafleet is an open corporation. What this means:

1. No one will ask you for isk to join.
2. No one will ask you to trade your assets to them in order to get you out to null.

If someone asks for these things, you are getting scammed and you need to notify a Recruiter immediately.

For any Recruitment matters please contact Toni Delancor, Elvallar Jaynara, Pari Shana, Bradley Johanis, Bo Hunt, or hop into our public channel listed above.

Be a part of something big.
