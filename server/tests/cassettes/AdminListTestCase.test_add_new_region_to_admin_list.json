                "description": "The Querious region was originally referred to as JK-FIX, and was seen as merely an administrative grouping for a large mass of disparate systems discovered near to the already-established Delve region. Many of these should by most conventions be part of Delve proper, but the growing Blood Raider presence in that region drove the administration at the time to fold them in with the rest of what is now Querious. When that region too was overrun by Blood forces the issue became irrelevant, but by then the maps had been finalized. The region was given its current name (a reference to an obscure piece of scripture) relatively recently, and while its original designation is no longer present anywhere in official records, part of it has been adopted by the region's hardy capsuleer residents who keep alive what they see as the old traditions.",
