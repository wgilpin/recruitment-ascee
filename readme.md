/server is the node backend

/client/src is the react frontend. Ignore the other files in /client

Getting started:

1. You'll need the app engine datastore keys to run it live, or your own service account on GAE in this project.

2. cd /server

   npm install
   
   npm start
   
or

3. cd /client

   yarn install
   
   yarn build

The front end url is /app
