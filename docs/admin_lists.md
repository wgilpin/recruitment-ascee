See [Admin Wireframes](https://github.com/wgilpin/recruitment-ascee/blob/master/docs/Admin%20Wireframe.png)

# Kinds

A list of [x] against which things are checked

* `character`: Characters
* `type`: Types (for Items/Ships)
* `channel`: Chat Channels
* `alliance`: Alliances
* `corporation`: Corps
* `system`: Systems

For each list thereâ€™s an ID

I think all we need is a list of IDs and we check all IDs against the same list?

But for the UI we need ID & Kind so that's the db model

# APIs

GET    `/api/admin/list/<kind>`

PUT    `/api/admin/list/<kind>/add`

PUT    `/api/admin/list/<kind>/replace`
