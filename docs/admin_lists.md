See [Admin Wireframes](https://github.com/wgilpin/recruitment-ascee/blob/master/docs/Admin%20Wireframe.png)

# Kinds

A list of [x] against which things are checked

* Characters
* Types (for Items/Ships)
* Chat Channels
* Alliances
* Corps
* Regions
* Systems

For each list thereâ€™s an ID

I think all we need is a list of IDs and we check all IDs against the same list?

But for the UI we need ID & Kind so that's the db model

# APIs

PUT    `/api/admin/list/<kind>/add`

Kind is the list of [x] above as text
